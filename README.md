# kls_Anonymization
Protecting a k-anonymized and l-diversified numerical dataset from semantic similarity related exploitations using class expansion/aggregation.

Implementation of  k anonymization with l diversity and s similarity using pandas and csv input file.


Two special similarity parameters(parameter s1: representing probability of duplicate sensitive values inside a class
and parameter s2: representing minimum relative standard deviation inside a class) are used to determine similarity index and 
along with contemporary k(anonymization) and l(diversity) parameters are used and classes are restructured and dataset is anonymized.
